This document defines the requirements an Indexer must meet to be eligible for indexing rewards. It includes the current active criteria, a schedule of any upcoming changes, and a log of all historical requirements. The goal is to provide a transparent and predictable set of standards for all network participants.

# Upcoming Eligibility Criteria

**We will announce changes to the eligibility criteria in the table below.** Once the change goes live, it will be reflected in the [Active Eligibility Criteria](https://github.com/graphprotocol/service-quality-oracle/blob/main/ELIGIBILITY_CRITERIA.md#active-eligibility-criteria) section of this document.

| Upcoming Requirement | Justification | Date Requirement Will Be Updated/Introduced (YYYY-MM-DD) |

# Active Eligibility Criteria

The following criteria are used to identify indexers that should be eligible to receive indexing rewards.

- **Days Online Requirement:** Indexers must be active for **5+ days** in a given **28 day** period for rewards eligibility.
- **Daily Query Requirement:** To be active, an indexer must serve at least **1 qualifying query** on **10 different subgraphs**.
- **Query Quality Requirements:** A qualifying query is one that simultaneously meets **all** of the following criteria:
  - Query Response HTTP Status: **200 OK**.
  - Query Response Latency: **< 5,000 ms**.
  - Query Freshness: **< 50,000 blocks** behind chainhead.

Eligibility for indexing rewards is typically refreshed daily via the ServiceQualityOracle contract.

> **Note**:
> Once an indexer has successfully qualified for indexing rewards by satisfying the active eligibility criteria, and a corresponding transaction has been submitted on chain by an authorized Oracle into the ServiceQualityOracle contract, the now eligible indexer can continue claiming indexing rewards from the protocol for the duration of the qualification period (default is 14 days), even if the active eligibility criteria change.
